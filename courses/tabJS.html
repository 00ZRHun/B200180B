        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Established in 1991, the department of Computer Science has  provided up-to-date diploma and degree courses in IT. The course curriculums are designed such that theories and practices are to work in tandem to achieve the following objectives:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To provide up-to-date courses. </li>
          <li>To prepare students for further studies and in their careers: to link with foreign universities for exemption of credits to shorten study duration and to provide conducive and pragmatic learning environments for graduates to enter the job market comfortably.</li>
          <li>To provide holistic education by combining humanism and technology. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Course features</h3>
        <p><strong>Experienced and qualified academic staff</strong></p>
        <p>The staff  have many years of teaching and working experience in education and IT industries. Certain subjects are taught by senior managers and CEOs from the private sectors. From time to time, visiting professors from Taiwan universities are also invited to give lectures in the department  to convey the latest IT info to students.  In such circumstances, students are being exposed to new technologies and their applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Academic activities and and IT Exhibitions</strong></p>
        <p>The department stresses the importance of technology and humanism. Students are encouraged to participate in activities organized by various societies in the campus. Students involved in those activities will learn team spirit and leadership, at the same time they will inspire them to think analytically and independently. Academic activities are equally important for students, they are encouraged to attend seminars, conferences and competitions to gain new knowledge. In the final year,  students are required to exhibit their projects to the public through IT exhibitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Close collaboration with private IT sectors</strong></p>
        <p>The department has collaborated and maintained good partnerships with many IT companies and organizations. This provides many opportunities for students to put their knowledge into practice. They are supervised and guided by experts in exploring computer systems and developing new software. Students are encouraged to undergo practical trainings provided by selected companies. In the final year, students need to come out with individual or team projects through the collaborations with related companies. The topics of the projects are closely related to computer systems and their software.</p>
        <p>Some companies generously sponsor our IT exhibitions or provide facilities for the benefit of students. We welcome both of them! </p>
        <h3>Prospects</h3>
        <p>We have the bachelor degree programs for those diploma students who would like to further their studies locally.</p>
        <p>However, if they choose to work, their qualifications and trainings should be sufficient for them to secure jobs in IT and commercial fields. Their careers include system programmers, system analysts, system engineers, database administrators, multimedia designers, network engineers, network administrators, network infrastructure designers, web designers, etc. Some of our graduates have successful careers in self-employments while others own software houses or computer-related companies. Their achievements  really make us proud!</p>
